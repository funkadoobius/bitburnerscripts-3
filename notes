Stats and jobs

These are still highly preliminary, but I found the following relations:

    INT benefits most jobs, except management. It's extremely important for R&D and engineers, and still important for ops and business.

    Creativity, the other stat which doesn't seem to change (except via augmentation upgrades from the main page), is very important for R&D and still important for Ops. Eng/Biz/Man don't seem to benefit from it, but esp. with Man, I'm not sure.
    By_Another_Name confirms that there's a minor effect on Managers. Thanks!

    Charisma is "people skills" and as such very important for Man/Biz, and (almost) useless for the rest.

    Efficiency sounds like a good stat in every job, but doesn't seem to affect biz. Its effect seems to be the strongest in jobs close to production, like Ops and Eng.

    Exp sounds like another great stat, but again, Biz doesn't get a lot out of it. Still not entirely useless. Engineers receive a huge boost, and the other jobs are somewhere between those extremes.

Sorted by job:

    Ops: EFF, EXP, INT, CRE, in roughly that order.

    Eng: EXP (huge effect), INT, EFF.

    Biz: CHA, INT, EXP.

    Man: CHA (huge effect), EXP, EFF.

    R&D: INT, CRE, EXP, EFF.

Morale, happiness, and energy seem to be productivity multipliers for all jobs, with about equal effects.
Finally, "unassigned" seems to be no different from training. The only difference is that an employee in "training" is sort of earmarked and less likely to be put in a job slot accidentally. No need to assign the employees as fast as possible.

/u/chapt3r I hope I got this stuff right. It's hell and a half to figure this out, even more so since most stats keep changing while I'm trying to compare their effects.

Speed

To get running ASAP, I'd suggest software and hiring one Ops, Eng, and Man. Get this site running, then, repeat the same at the other sites, and you have a production multiplier of 6. You need 5 levels of Advert Inc. too, to sell all your stuff.
Then, don't hire more staff, but buy another warehouse and booster stuff (hardware, a few robots). Don't buy too much - you don't want to clog the warehouses, but don't let all that capacity go to waste either. Upgrades of your employees are still too expensive; it's better to buy another warehouse and more stuff, and to keep their energy and happiness >95%. Staying at office level 1 saves both salaries and the expensive office purchases.
In long bitnodes, you want to work towards 600B for real estate, which makes some "real" money, and the Export upgrade. Unfortunately, most BNs end before you get there.
